# hw3-passwords

## Motivation

Creating a secure password seems like it would be easy to do off the top of your head, but there are many ways people can guess passwords these days even using computer programs designed to do so. The need for a secure password is more important than ever these days, and this program will help you do that by completely randomly generating a list of characters. People often use simple things that they can remember and have meaning to them, and therefore can be easy to guess. If you truely want a secure password, this web application will create one for you. Just be sure to remember it! Or store it somewhere secure.

## What to expect when using this program:

You will be prompted with questions regarding the contents of the password that you would like generated; length, uppercase, lowercase, symbols, and numbers. The program requires at least one character type and for your length to be between 8 and 128 characters long to ensure true security. The program will not create a password outside of these parameters.
